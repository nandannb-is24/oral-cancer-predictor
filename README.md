Oral Cancer Risk Predictor
AI-powered image analysis + clinical risk assessment

This project is a Streamlit-based web application that predicts oral cancer risk using:

A deep learning model (CNN) trained on intra-oral lesion images

A clinical questionnaire (smoking, alcohol, prior lesions, symptoms, etc.)

A combined risk scoring system that merges image-based and patient-based factors

The goal is to create a simple, fast, and effective screening system that helps with early detection.

🚀 Features
🔍 1. Image-based cancer risk prediction

Upload an intra-oral image (JPG/PNG).
The CNN model analyzes lesion areas such as:

Leukoplakia

Erythroplakia

Non-healing ulcers

Suspicious patches

📝 2. Clinical Questionnaire (Required)

Enhances prediction accuracy using:

Smoking & tobacco history

Alcohol consumption

Prior oral lesions / biopsy / dysplasia

Current symptoms & duration

Family history of cancer

HPV history

🧠 3. Combined Risk Scoring

Machine learning output + clinical risk factors =
Final estimated risk (Low / Moderate / High).

🎨 4. Clean, single-page UI

Modern, card-based layout

Easy to present in college or project demos

All inputs validated

No backend required — everything runs in Streamlit
